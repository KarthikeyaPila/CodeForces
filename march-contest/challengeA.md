You are given four integers: a, b, c, and d. Your task is to calculate the maximum possible value of the expression (ab + cd) by rearranging the numbers.

Input
Four space-separated integers a, b, c, and d ( 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 100 )

Output
A single integer representing the maximum possible value of (a*b + c*d)

Examples
Input
1 2 3 4
Output
14
Input
5 2 4 1
Output
22
Note
In first test case :

The maximum value is achieved by arranging the numbers as 3,4,1,2 => 3*4 + 1*2 = 12 + 2 = 14.

In second test case :

The maximum value is achieved by arranging the numbers as 1,2,4,5 => 1*2 + 4*5 = 2 + 20 = 22.
